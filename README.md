These are some of the Games I've built using Object Oriented Programming and turtle. All of these games feature a scoreboard to track the player's progress, and as the levels advance, the speed of the gameplay becomes progressively faster.

<b>Snake:</b> A classic video game where the player controls a growing snake and tries to avoid running into obstacles.

<b>Pong:</b> A simple 2D sports game where players use paddles to hit a ball back and forth across a screen.

<b>Turtle_Crossing:</b> A game where the player controls a turtle and guides it to the other side of the screen while avoiding obstacles, such as bricks.
